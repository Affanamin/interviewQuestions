what are the key differences b/w spark and map reduce ?

Map reduce was a go to framework before spark for distributed computing, the reason we switched to spark is that map reduce has 2 
processes, One is map where it saves all data distributedly to disk and the reduce process get the data from disk and perform computation

Spark works as in memory computation so all the data will be stored in RAM, and it is very fast then mapreduce. 

Spark also stored the data to disk, right ? then what is the difference ?

yes sark stores the data to disk BUT only when we explicitly says that to store in disk or when the RAM space goes to its end otherwise not,
and with good configurations of spark it can be overcome as well
